target: 
1. Run the camera successfully.
2. Take a photo.
3. Record a video.

problem 1:
'sudo apt full-upgrade'
=>
Configuration file '/etc/xdg/labwc/environment'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** environment (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? Y

result: installed NEW packages

problem 2:
*recording video*
camera turn on => OK
recording video => probably OK
check video just recorded => NO (not solved)
It can't play fluently and may crash after 1 second.

failed. WTF imma going to ask chatgpt but this berry seems to be burning. 

libcamera-vid -t 10000 --save-pts timestamps.txt -o test-time.h264
-----------------------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
=>seems not working on Pi5
22:43 ***after reading loooooots of articles AHHHHHHH***
if you want to play video on rsby 
=>you have to record timestamp in the video. 
=>'libcamera-vid' doesn't support '--save-pts' on Pi5 *maybe*
=>use 'rpicam-vid -o test.mkv' instead.
=>result: can record and play the video.
